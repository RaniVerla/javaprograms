this(),super()
These are constructor calls ,to call super class and  current class constructors 
We can use only in constructor as first statement
We can use only one at a time but not both simultaneously

this,super
These are the keywords to refer super class and current class instance members 
We can use anywhere except static area
We can write any number of times


class superclass {
	int x = 10;
}

public class Test extends superclass {
	int x = 20;
  //public static void m1(){ 
	//public void m1() {
		System.out.println(x);
		System.out.println(this.x);
		System.out.println(super.x);
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Test t = new Test();
		t.m1();
	}
}

OP:
20
20
10
OP if we use static method instead of normal method we get 
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problems: 
	Cannot use this in a static context
	Cannot use super in a static context
	
Aggregation vs Composition
1.Dependency: Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. For example, Bank and Employee, delete the Bank and the Employee still exist. whereas Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent. Example: Human and heart, heart don’t exist separate to a Human
2.Type of Relationship: Aggregation relation is “has-a” and composition is “part-of” relation.
3.Type of association: Aggregation is a weak Association and Composition is a strong Association whereas .
